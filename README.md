### Local Installation

In `build/distributions` there is a zip file that I can manually import into my regular PhpStorm installation (Settings -> Plugins -> Gear Icon -> install plugin from disk).

### Development

The initial settings for the formerly recommended development environment, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, as described by JetBrains in the [custom UI theme workflow](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/themes.html#custom-ui-theme-workflow), has been removed in favor of a simple build script since release 1.0.0. You can also create a zip file manually, see the instructions below.

For creating future theme plugins, you do not need a complex Gradle setup, as there is a new
wizard for creating a UI theme. See:
- https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2021/10/themes-in-intellij-based-ides/
- https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/theme-structure.html

> A plugin consisting of a single .jar file is placed in the /plugins directory.
Source: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/plugin-content.html

To find out the internal names of UI elements, we can now use the [UI inspector](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2021/10/themes-in-intellij-based-ides/#UI_Inspector%EF%BB%BF).

The `.palette-info.css` in the root directory can be used for a better editor preview, if the IDE does not show color previews in `.xml` and `.json` configuration files.

Supposedly original Commodore colors have no suffix, alternative additions possibly created by the demo scene have an "Alternative" suffix, both are found on screenshots and digital artwork. Colors found on The Commodores records, tour posters, or concert photography, are marked with a "Music" or "MusicAlternative", or "Fashion" suffix. Some additional alternative colors have been used in other Open Mind Culture themes like Orange Rain or Cute Pink Light/Dark Theme.

### Development, Build and Export

- Edit colors in `src/main/META-INF/commodore_night_dark_theme.json`.
- As a contributor:
  - create a pull request on GitHub.
- As a maintainer:
  - Edit theme version, supported IDE versions, and other data, in 
    - `src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml`
    - `src/main/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`
    - `package.json`
    - `gradle.properties` (only used for IntelliJ gradle build)
    - `build.gradle.kts` (only used for IntelliJ gradle build)
  - Build using one of the methods described below. 
  - Add a change log in `CHANGELOG.md`. 
  - Add a git tag, create a release, and add the theme zip.
  - Upload the theme zip to JetBrains marketplace.

#### Shell Build

`npm run build`

- requires `bash`/`sh`!
- creates a `build/distributions/intellij-commodore-night-theme-x.y.z.zip`

#### Alternative Manual Export (without IntelliJ Build Process)

Create an archive `commodore-night-dark-theme-x.y.z.zip` containing:
  - `commodore-night-theme-dark-theme/` 
    - `lib/`
      - `intellij-commodore-night-theme-x.y.z.jar`
        The `.jar` file is another zip archive containing the contents of `src/main/resources`
        with **no additional folder in between, e.g.:
          - `commodore_night_dark.theme.json`
          - `commodore_night_dark.xml`
          - `META-INF/`
            - `plugin.xml`
            - `pluginIcon.svg`
            - `MANIFEST.MF`

A valid `MANIFEST.MF` example is included to simplify theme export and update.

You can use the build script `./build.sh $version` to build, e.g.
`./build.sh 2.9.0`

#### Upgrade Plugin for new IDEA versions

- bump plugin version
- add current IDEA version to supported targets
- rebuild artifacts as described above
